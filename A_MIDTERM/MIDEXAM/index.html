            <h2>Discover Your Zodiac Sign</h2>
            <p>The constellations in the night sky are connected to myth and legend, as well as the unscientific concepts of astrology. But they also have held importance and usefulness to science and exploration throughout history and still today.
                Stars in the universe are scattered across a vast, three-dimensional space. When we look up from the surface of our planet, however, humans have historically observed constellations: two-dimensional pictures and shapes connecting the stars in the sky to stories from cultures around the globe. 
                In addition to their cultural significance, constellations have also been important instruments that once marked the passage of time and the seasons. Today, constellations continue to be valuable tools to orient astronomers and stargazers in the night sky. 
                One constellation tradition is the western zodiac, which is made up of 12 constellations: Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.</p>
