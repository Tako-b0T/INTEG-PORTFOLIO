            <h1>St. Mark Cathedral</h1>
            <h2>Address Infanta, 4336 Quezon</h2>
            <p>Infanta, Quezon, is a coastal town in the Philippines known for its rich history and serene atmosphere. Nestled between the Sierra Madre mountains and the Pacific Ocean, it offers a unique blend of natural beauty and historical significance.</p>
            <p>One of the town's most notable landmarks is the Church of Saint Mark the Evangelist, which was established in 1578. Initially constructed from bamboo and nipa, the church was rebuilt with stone in 1732 after a fire destroyed the original structure. Over the years, it has stood as a testament to the town's resilience and devotion. The church also played a vital role in the community, housing a tribunal and serving as a center for primary education, funded by the local people.</p>
            <p>The reason why this is my favorite place stems from having a catholic family and here I was baptized and we go here to proclaim our faith and communicate with God. </p>
            <p>Another factor as to why this is my favorite place is because I had education at MCSI (the school next to the church. *Not in the picture*), from kindergarden to 12th grade and have been at the church for almost half of my life. I remember the times where I sang as a part of the choir, played in the parking lot with my friends while waiting for our parents to pick us up, attended mass with my family and here my family said their goodbyes to my grandmother. This place is more than just a church to me it holds the weight of every hug, every goodbye, and every cherished moment that ever happened here.</p>
